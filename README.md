:question: **What is this Repository About?**
This tutorial features demonstrations on HTTP Repository/Client Design Pattern Implementation, Generic Base HTTP Repository/Client Implementation, and the practical application of the Factory Design Pattern. Enhance your design pattern knowledge and skills with expert insights from a seasoned professional.

**What Will You Learn?**
- **Exploring the HTTP Repository/Client Design Pattern:** Demonstration of implementing this pattern for improved data management and access in your tests.
- **Generic Base HTTP Repository/Client Implementation:** Practical guidance on creating reusable components for HTTP interactions.
- **Applying the Factory Design Pattern:** Discover how to use the Factory Design Pattern to create objects in a more flexible and controlled manner.

**:file_folder: What is the Repository Design Pattern?**
The Repository Design Pattern is a strategy used in software development to separate the way data is stored and retrieved from the business logic of an application. This pattern acts as a bridge between the application's business logic and the database or data source, providing a central place for all data access operations.

**:factory: What is the Factory Design Pattern?**
The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It addresses the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, using a Factory method instead of direct constructor calls.

### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
